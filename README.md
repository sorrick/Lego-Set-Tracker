# Lego-Set-Tracker
A GUI Application that tracks Lego sets for the user. The idea came from a project I did in school where I had to create a GUI application where the user can enter information and the information will be saved on a database. I use SQL to save to and read from the database where the Lego information is saved on. Lego sets provide lots of tracking info which are all presented on the Lego Tracker GUI screen:

The user can enter new Lego sets, view all sets saved, edit previous sets, and delete sets. Below is the edit screen:

I also included an about page detailing more about my reasoning for creating the project:
